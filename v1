' Steps to Use:
' 1. Open Outlook.
' 2. Press ALT+F11 to open the VBA Editor.
' 3. Insert a new module (Click "Insert" -> "Module").
' 4. Copy and paste the entire code below into the module.
' 5. Press ALT+F8, select "CreateYearlyFolderStructure", and click "Run".
' 6. When prompted, enter the desired year (e.g., 2026) in the input box.
' 7. Next, select the target inbox that contains your "Archive - Valuation Reports" folder.
' 8. The script will automatically create the folder structure for the specified year:
'      - A folder for that year (e.g., "2026") under "Archive - Valuation Reports".
'      - Month folders (e.g., "2026.01", "2026.02", ..., "2026.12") inside the year folder.
'      - Day folders for each business day (Monday-Friday) in each month, formatted as "YYYY.MM.DD".
'      - On the last business day of each month, additional subfolders (e.g., "0 FX London", "1 FX Toronto", etc.)
'        are created inside that day folder.
' 9. A message box will confirm once the folders are created successfully.
