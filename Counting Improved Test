' Steps to Use:
' 1. Open Excel.
' 2. Press ALT+F11 to open the VBA Editor.
' 3. Insert a new module (Insert â†’ Module).
' 4. Copy and paste the entire code below into the module.
' 5. Press ALT+F8, select "CountEmailsBySubjectGroup_NoArrays", and click "Run".
' 6. When prompted, select the Month folder (e.g. "2026.01") that contains your day folders.
' 7. The macro will process each day folder (except the one with the maximum date) and output:
'      - A "Summary" worksheet listing each day folder (date) and the counts for each group.
'      - A "Not Counted" worksheet listing the folder and subject of emails that did not match any group.
'      - For the last day folder, the counts are taken from its subfolders:
'           "0 FX London", "1 FX Toronto", "2 GEDA GELP", "3 FX Options", _
'           "4 Structured Credit", "5 Structured Rates", "6 Bonds", _
'           "7 Commodities", "8 London IRS", "9 Toronto IRS", "9.1 CDS"
